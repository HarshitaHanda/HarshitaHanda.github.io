    <pre><i>
        Hey, you
        I'm just now leaving
        Can I come around later on this evening?
        Or do you need time?
        Yes, of course, that's fine
        Hey, you
        Good morning
        I'm sure you're busy now, why else would you ignore me?
        Or do you need space?
        You can't help it if your mind has changed
        So go ahead and break my heart again
        Leave me wondering why the hell I ever let you in
        Are you the definition of insanity?
        Or am I?
        Oh, it must be nice
        To love someone who lets you break them twice
        You're so blue
        Are you still breathing?
        Won't you tell me if you found that deeper meaning?
        Do you think I've gone blind?
        I know it's not the truth when you say, "I'm fine"
        So go ahead and break my heart again
        Leave me wonderin' why the hell I ever let you in
        Are you the definition of insanity?
        Or am I?
        Oh, it must be nice
        To love someone who lets you break them twice
        So don't pretend that I'm the instigator
        You were the one, but you're born to say goodbye
        Kissed me half a decade later
        That same perfume, those same sad eyes
        Go ahead and break my heart again
        Leave me wonderin' why the hell I ever let you in
        Are you the definition of insanity?
        Or am I?
        Or am I?
        Must be nice
        To love someone who lets you break them twice</i></pre>
